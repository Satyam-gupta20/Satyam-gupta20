# 👋 Hi, I'm Satyam Gupta

I'm a Backend & Data Engineer with 5+ years of experience building APIs, data platforms, and internal tools that drive growth across developer, product, and community teams.

My core strength lies in designing APIs, automating data flows, and building self-serve analytics tools that improve decision-making for developers, community managers, and business leaders.

At **MongoDB**, I built a Streamlit + Flask analytics platform used by 40+ Developer Advocates and senior leaders (including the CMO) to track content performance, engagement, and campaign attribution. I also developed backend pipelines that ingest data from platforms like Meetup, Wrike, Medium, and Dev.to into **MongoDB Atlas + Trino**, powering insights in Salesforce for community and marketing teams.

I've worked across REST and GraphQL APIs, built scalable ETL pipelines, and contributed to systems used by 200K+ developers. I collaborate closely with DevRel, Product, Marketing and Community teams to align engineering work with business goals.

Previously at **Innovaccer**, I led FHIR API ingestion pipelines for Snowflake and built Flask + React dashboards to drive data visibility across departments.

I’m passionate about solving problems at the intersection of **data, engineering, and UX**—whether it’s building the right API, delivering clean attribution data, or making internal metrics more actionable.

I've also mentored students from underserved communities via **Mentors Without Borders** and **Prayas NGO**, teaching Python, analytics, and project-building skills.
